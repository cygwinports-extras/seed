ldesc: "Seed is a library and interpreter, dynamically bridging (through 
GObject-Introspection) the WebKit JavaScriptCore engine with the GObject 
type system. In a more concrete sense, Seed enables you to immediately 
write applications around a significant portion of the GNOME platform, 
and easily embed JavaScript as a scripting language in your GObject 
library."
